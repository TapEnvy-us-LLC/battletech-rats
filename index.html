    <h1>Welcome to BattleTech RATs!</h1>
    <p>
      What you're going to find here is a collection of <abbr title="Random Assignment Tables">RATs</abbr>
      available for use with the BattleTech Table Top system. These RATs come from players and rule books
      alike and are meant to help assist only! The core rule books are still required to fully understand
      and utilize what is here.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can get the core books directly from <a href='https://catalystgamelabs.com'>CGL</a> or
      <a href='https://drivethrurpg.com'>DriveThruRPG</a> and highly recommend getting, at the very least,
      the core rule books.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any of the RATs are based on a specific book, or set of books, links will be provided for their source
      for you to purchase directly from either of the two stores above. Some links may be affiliate links and will
      be marked as such and who they support.
